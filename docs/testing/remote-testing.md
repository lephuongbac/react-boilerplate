# Remote testing

```Shell
npm run start:tunnel
```

Starts the development server similarly to `npm start`, with an extra address XXX.localtunnel.me where XXX is 
your app name configured in `package.json`.

This means your app is accessible from the entire world! 
This is great for testing on different devices and from different locations.
