    quote1: '“Excellent. . . . [Bernstein] covers China’s political context in 1945 like a scholar, but maintains his journalist’s eye for human drama.”',
    quoteBy1: 'New York Times Book Review',
    quote2: '“An important book. . . . a cautionary tale at a time when the United States confronts a resurgent China, and its communist leaders, across the Pacific Ocean and wonders again if they can be believed.”',
    quoteBy2: 'The Washington Post',
    quote3: '“Skillfully crafted. . . . Bernstein is a talented storyteller. . . . Provides a rich account of just how far the Communist leaders went in wooing, and misleading, the Americans.”',
    quoteBy3: 'The Wall Street Journal',
    description: 'At the beginning of 1945, relations between America and the Chinese Communists couldn’t have been closer. Chinese leaders talked of America helping to lift China out of poverty; Mao Zedong himself held friendly meetings with U.S. emissaries. By year’s end, Chinese Communist soldiers were setting ambushes for American marines; official cordiality had been replaced by chilly hostility and distrust, a pattern which would continue for a quarter century, with the devastating wars in Korea and Vietnam among the consequences.',

    quoteBy3: 'Los Angeles Times',
    description: 'In 629, the revered Buddhist monk Hsuan Tsang set out across Asia in search of the Ultimate Truth, and to settle what he called “the perplexities of my mind.” From the Tang dynasty capital at Xian through ancient Silk Road oases, over forbidding mountain passes to Tashkent, Samarkand, and the Amu-Darya River, across Pakistan to the holiest cities of India–and back again–his sixteen-year journey was beset with every hardship imaginable. Pilgrimage complete, Hsuan Tsang wrote an account of his trek that is still considered one of the classics of Chinese literature.',
